To make houses.


edit spec_assign.c     
   find the assign_rooms procedure.

   add the room # of the room to the structure, and the House procedure
   (just like the existing entries)

   then, edit the world file, and make sure that the room's name
   corresponds with the characters name.

   for example:

   Loki's bedroom is ok, because the characters name is the first X
   chars in the room's name, where x is the length of the character's name

   The bedroom of Loki   is NOT ok.  


adding monsters and objects.

Do not edit the obj and mob file while the game is up. the game reads info
from this file constantly, and will screw up if the file is altered.  
(it uses a byte count to index the file, so a change in 1 byte can screw
up everything.


to add new boards, you need to add a blank file, with the name

XXXX.messages


XXXX == the virtual # of the board.   So, the regular temple board
  (3099) has the corresponding file  3099.messages.


You also have to add the board to the assign_objs procedure in spec_assign


Traps:

   traps are more or less working, but since I don't have the skill set up
   I have not made them a regular part of the game.

   

Item heaping: 

	needs to be changed, so that the only thing that is important is
	the description, item #, or mob # should be unimportant for
	differentiation.
