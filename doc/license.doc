                             SillyMud License
 
Rules:
 
     SillyMUD is not public domain, it is copywritten source with the
copywrite ownership being retained by both the DIKU university and
the University of Florida, as well as the authors of SillyMUD (see credits).
You may distribute the source freely, but the copyright must remain intact,
as well as this user license.  You may not sell the source or gain any money
from it's distribution, not even for a charge-per-ftp service.
SillyMUD can only legally be run if you keep the name SillyMUD and the
name DikuMUD in the login sequence.  Also, the base version must stay in
the world command.  Note, to run this legally, you MUST keep the credits
file intact!
 
 
Notes:
 
SillyMUD is based on DikuMUD.  Although most of the diku code was removed,
we still acknowlege their work on the concept.  (we can't say all is removed,
because nobody has gone through lately to find any last little bits).
