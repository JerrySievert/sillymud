RLOAD
This is an immortal room creation command.
format: rload <beginning # of your area> <end # of your area>

WALK

This is what people who aren't flying have to do to get from point A to
point B.  If you are flying, and you are doing it because of a spell or
a racial intrinsic (sorry, if it's an object, remove it) you can choose
to walk or fly.  If you are currently flying, the walk command will stop
that.  When you decide you want to take to the air again, use the FLY
command.

SEE ALSO: FLY
#
FLY

If you stopped flying with the WALK command, you can return to the skies
via this command.  If WALK will work for you, FLY should too.

SEE ALSO: WALK
#
RSAVE
This is an immortal room creation command.
format: rsave <beginning # of your area> <end # of your area>

You use this command to write the rooms you have made to disk.  To
retrieve them, use the RLOAD command.  RSAVE your area OFTEN!  That way
if something unforseen arises (ie: a crash) you will not loose much
work.  Remember to RLOAD your are b4 you RSAVE it.  If you do not, you
will save an empty area over yours.  IF THIS HAPPENS, DO NOTHING MORE.
Find someone with code access and ask them to restore your backup area
file.  Every Time you save the previous save file is made into the backup
one.

DONATE
Usage : DONATE <item>

The donate command is used to be a nice person and send something to the
Donation Room for other people (especially Newbies) to have.  All you have
to do is type 'donate sword' (for example), and the donation room gets your
sword.  

See Also: JUNK, DUMP
#
JUNK
Usage : JUNK <item>

The junk command is used to get rid of unused garbage that you or nobody 
else would want.  All you need to do is type 'junk sword' (for example),
and nobody will ever have to worry about it again.  Note: You can also
type 'junk all.sword' if you have a lot of them you need to get rid of.

There is a small amount of compensation for junking an item.  If you are
under 3rd level, you get exp for junking.  If you are 3rd level or higher,
you get half of the amount of gold you would have gotten by dropping the 
item in the dump.  However, in either case, the amount isn't a whole lot
of gold, and you just might consider donating it for others to use.
 
See Also: DUMP, DONATE
#
DUMP
Usage : DROP <item> (at the Dump of course!)

The dump is a place to get rid of unused garbage that you or nobody 
else would want.  All you need to do is type 'drop sword' (for example),

the need for a client program.  Typing auto with an argument toggles the
feature ON or OFF.  Currently, the argument options are:

Auto loot will automatically take the gold from any monsters you kill.  It
gives the gold to the person who killed the mob.  Default is OFF.

Auto split will automatically split your gold among all the members of your
group IF you are grouped.  Default is OFF.

DISPLAY
Usage : DISPLAY [0..1]

Display allows you to change your term setup on the mud, allowing you to
have an info-bar on the bottom of your screen.  The info-bar contains
your hit points, your mana, your movement points, your gold, and your
experience points.

   Currently, display uses VT100 term setups.  To turn display onto
VT100, use the "1" option.  To turn off the VT100 display, use the "0"
option.

#
RESIZE
Usage : RESIZE [size]

Resize allows you to change your screen size.  The default is a 25 line
screen, but not everyone uses 25 lines.  Resize allows you to change
your setup to your own screen size (allow for a total line count).
RESIZE 25 would reset you to a normal display size.

ONE LIFER

In order to become a "one lifer" you need to go to the temple altar and
"pray one life".  Upon doing so, your stats (primarily charisma, and the
pre-requisite stat for your class(es)) will increase.  

-What this means:

Upon receiving Odin's blessing you are limited to one life.  Upon dying
you are disconnected from the game and deleted.  Again, once you die you
are disconnected from the game and deleted.  So you ask, what does
Odin's blessing entail?  Currently you gain double experience for every
kill.  You learn faster (practice better).  You regenerate your move-
ment, hitpoints and mana faster.  Cityguards call you studs.  Your ego
is higher (enabling you access to better equiment at lower levels).  
This is a very new idea to SillyMUD and we are still playing around with
what one lifer benifits should be.  Suggestions should be posted on the
mortal board at the Temple Altar
#
BREWING

This is a relatively new skill.  It enables someone to gather various
ingrediants to form a potion.  Currently ony one kind of potion is
manufacurable and it's components are shrouded in code.  It will be
expanded at a later date.
#
FORCE

When someone is being a butthead and doesn't want to give you your taco
back, what do you do?  You force them to.  Fortunately for most, only
gods have this ability.  They can: "force butthead give taco loki", and
voila if Loki is around, and butthead has a taco, Loki is given it.
Some of the more powerful gods are able to force all, meaning that they
can force everyone to give a taco to Loki.
#
INSET

Usage:  inset <gem> <weapon>

The weapon must not be smaller than the gem, or else you can't inset the
gem into the weapon.  (No plans are being made to insert weapons into
gems.)  If the weapon is not over-enchanted allready, and you make a
successful skill check, the affects on the gem will be added to those of
the weapon.  If you fail the skill check, you will damage the weapon
and scrap the gem.  A successful insetting will also increase the
weapon's ego by the gem's amount.

#
DISGUISE

Disguise is a skill that allows thieves to disguise themselves.  What
does this mean, I hear you cry.  Well.  This won't do squat against pcs.
BUT, those pesky mobs that hate you and fear you will forget who you are
if you disguise yourself well.   This is a learnable skill.
#
MONKS

Monks are masters of harmony.  They are very aware of their internal
balance and are resistant to things that upset that balance.  This
characteristic does not necessarily force them to be neutral.  Over time
their training enables them hit attack others with their bare hands and
to kick things with amazing force.  Their focus on their being
neutralizes any affect dexterity would normally have on their armor
class.  Very little is reflex anymore.  As they become more powerful
they become resistant and eventually immune to things that would disturb
their internal balance.  These include poison, haste, charm, slow,
and paralyze.  By 11th level a monk is allready immune to haste, slow
and paralyze.  At 15th level they develop a resistance to poison which
turns into an immunity at 32nd.  At 18th level they are resistant to
charm.  At 36th level they are immune to it.

Monks are designed to be weak and equipment starved at low levels.  At
high levels they rival single class warriors.

"MONK DAMAGE"

This is a list of what a monk's bare hand damage is.

Level  Damage     Level  Damage     Level  Damage     Level  Damage
 1- 3   1d3       15-19   2d4       30-34   4d4       42-44   6d4

12-14   2d3       27-29   4d3
#
"MONK ATTACKS"

This is a list of how many attacks a monk gets when he is fighting bare
handed. The formula used for the number of attacks that an unarmed monk
will get per
round will be: (level-1)/16 +1   --The fractional portion will provide
the probability of getting an extra attack each round. (ie. if you were
VERY lucky, a 2nd level monk could get 2 attacks every round, but
probably won't)

[a few samples: Level--#Att]
 1--1.00    5--1.25    9--1.50   13--1.75   17--2.00   21--2.25
25--2.50   29--2.75   33--3.00   37--3.25   41--3.50   45--3.75
49--4.00 

#
"DRUIDS"

Druids are the guardians of nature.  They remain neutral with regard to
other concerns.  As such, they are forbidden to player kill other
players.  They can, however, enlist the aid of those less scrupulous.
After 14th level, a druid is no longer able to be charmed.  They develop
a resistance to poison at 15th level, and the immunity at 32nd level.
At 20th level they gain a natural resistance to electricity, at 30th a
resistance to cold, and at 40th a resistance to fire.

If a druid strays from the path (ie: is no longer neutral) they will
slowly loose their ability to cast spells and will not be able to change
forms.  They farther they stray from neutrality, the harder it is for
them to cast spells.

Druids seem to be a little weaker than other classes.  If you have
suggestions to improve their playability, please post them.

#
"GROUP GROUPING"
Usage : GROUP [player]

Some new changes to encourage grouping.   
1) leader of a group gets 5% exp bonus per kill per pc in group
2) followers get 3% bonus (per pc)

If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for
killing monsters equally among the group. Experience points will only
be shared among group members that are in the same location, at the
time of the killing blow. Sharing is regardless of whether the group
members have been participating in the fight.

Group with no argument show a list of people with whom you are grouped.

To make a group, a "leader" must be selected. All members of the group
must then "follow" the leader using the follow command. The leader
group.  If followers are present when the the spell is cast on the group
leader, anyone in the room that is grouped is transported.

"HOLY WORD"

Usage       : cast 'holy word'
Accumulative: No
Duration    : Instantaneous
Save        : None, if you are a proper target.

With this spell, the cleric calls upon the raw power of their diety to
smite differently aligned people.  This is a VERY hostile spell capable
of wreaking great devastation of disbelievers.  This spell is an area of
affect one, and as such, all non-grouped people will be subjected to it.
Neutral clerics will affect both evil and good victims, good clerics
will only affect evil victims and evils clerics will only affect the
good.  If the victims falls within one of those parameters they are
considered a valid target.  Should the target be an extra-planar being,
they will be destroyed and their spirit banished to their home plane.
If the victim is not an extra-planar being then the affect of the word
is dependant on the level difference of the caster and the victim.
Should this level difference be greater than 30, the victim will be
utterly destroyed by the clerics show of power.  Should this difference
be greated than 20, the victim will be damaged for the difference * 3
points of damage, they will be blinded and paralyzed (in awe, no doubt)
for a period no longer than the caster's level divided by 10.  The
difference be greater than 10, the victim will be damaged the difference
* 2 hitpoints and will be silenced and blinded for a period not to
exceed the caster's level divided by 10.  Should the difference only be
somewhere between 1 to 9, the cleric's word will knock the victim on
their butt and blind them for a period not to exceed the caster's level
divided by 10.  If the caster is actually of lower level than the
target, this spell will just piss the victim off.

"EGO"

Ego is the term labeled to a character's willpower.  It gets bigger as a
character progresses through their career.  Items and players both have
egos.  When you attempt to use an item, your ego is matched against the
item's.  If the item't ego is bigger than yours, it usually refuses to
be used by you, but there is some randomness associated with it.  Your
ego is also partially based on your current health.  As you approach
death your willpower goes down.  If your ego drops below what you need
to wear your items, they will start jumping off of you.  Listed below is
the hierarchy of egos (from smallest, but not reaching Loki's.)

itty bitty -> teenie weenie -> miniscule -> trifling -> wimpy -> humble
-> computer geek -> small -> mediocre -> unimpressive -> boring ->
normal -> moderate -> average -> fair -> snotty -> notable -> strong ->
large -> impressive -> huge -> enourmous -> gigantic -> humongous ->
mammoth -> gargantuan -> colossal -> monstrous -> herculean -> egomaniac

Item's egos are also measured against these ranges.

be displayed.

   It also helps when attempting to value an item carried by another 
person.  Usually, it will tell that person that you are looking at a particular
item.. however, if you successfully spy, they won't notice.
#
"DOORBASH"

  Doorbashing is a skill that allows one to open locked doors.  One must
refer to the door by name, not the direction of travel.  For example
doorbash gate
doorbash door north
etc.

  Success means that the door is unlocked and opened and the attempter is placed
in the room on the other side of the door, while failure causes the attempter 
to be stunned for a short time, and take a fair amount of damage in the process.
#
"DISARM"

   There are two kinds of disarm.  Disarming weapons and disarming traps.

If one types "disarm monstername", then, if the player has the disarm
weapon skill, and successfully uses it, the monster's weapon will fly from
its hand/tentacle, etc.   

If one types "disarm trapname", if the player has the disarm traps skill,
one can attempt to disable the trap.. failure indicates a high probability
that the trap will be sprung on the player attempting the disarm.

#
"SIGN LANGUAGE"
   You can learn to use sign language now.  Useful when underwater,
or in a silenced room, (or silenced yourself).  whatever the user types
is broadcast, possibly somewhat garbled depending on his/her skill with
signing, and all those in the room who understand sign language will 
receive the possibly garbled message.

#
"MOUNT RIDING"

  it is now possible to mount horses and dragons.. Certain aspects are
not finalized, so it is not advisable to mount aggressive dragons.  Currently
there are no horses of the correct race to be ridden, so, for the moment, it
is only possible to ride dragons.  However, dragons are not docile creatures,
and it will take a large amount of riding skill, and a high level character
to do it with any amount of ability.  You can order your mount to do things,
as if he/she was a follower, but he/she isn't, so you can't group with the
mount.  Each time you attack something, or your mount attacks something, or
each time you take damage or your mount takes damage, you have a chance of
being thrown from the back of your mount.  

it is easier for evil chars to ride evil dragons, and good chars to ride
good dragons.  

  To get an idea of how powerful one has to be to ride dragons, 
a 60th level character can typically only successfully ride on
Yevaud if said character has a -1000 alignment, or is affected
by the dragon-riding spell.  Or if yevaud is heavily damaged.

#
"ALIAS"

   alias -- no arguments - shows a list of your existing aliases.   
   alias <num> command -- assigns the command to the number num, which
	has to be between 0 and 9. 
   <num> will execute this command.

   example:
   
   > alias 1 kill

   > 1 lamia
   You hit the lamia.

   Get the idea?   Only one cmmand per alias, I have been having nightmares
	trying to figure out all the ways one could crash the game with
        multi-command aliases


#
"SHOOT"

	hold a bow (from the midgaard weapons seller), wield an arrow
	(also from midgaard weapons seller).  then shoot an opponent.
	the arrows are fragile, and break easily, so be careful!

#
"SWITCH"
  Allows you to switch opponents.  if you are attacking X and want to attack
	Y, type 'hit Y'.  It will check against your Switch skill, and if
	you make it, you stop attacking X, and attack Y.. if you fail, you
	stop attacking anyone.
#
"VALUE"
	tells you the value/vital stats of something.  for example,
	value sword will tell you interesting stuff about the sword.

	but only if you have the appropriate lore skill.

	to use it, type 'consider X', if X is a race that you know lore
	about, you can get some info on the race.  As your ability with the
	skill improves, your estimates will improve.
#
"DODGE"

	dodge allows fighters and monks to avoid damage in combat.  not 
	a lot -- 1-3 points, but every little bit helps.  Each time you
	are hit, the game checks your dodge skill, which does not improve
	with use, only with practice.  if you make it, the damage is 
	reduced by 1-3 points.. note- this applies to physical attacks
	only.

#
"RETREAT"
	allows a fighter, thief or monk to get out of combat without 
	having to panic and flee. if you make the roll, you WILL leave
	the room, and you lose no exp for doing it.  

	this skill gets better through use.

	this skill does not have a name of its own, but is built in
	to the 'flee' command.

#
"FEIGN DEATH"
	allows a monk to pretend that they are dead.  The people/things
	that are attacking you will stop fighting you, and may leave you
	alone completely, although it is best to leave the room as soon
	as possible.
#
"PALM"
	This skill enables you to get things without other people
noticing.  Same usage format as the command "get".
#
"PEEK"
	This skill enables you to look at other people without them
noticing. Same usage format as the command "look".
#
"BERSERK"

	This skill is rumored to be taught by a certain Jones 'The
Cruncher' Ettin who inhabits the sewers.  For a nominal fee, Jones will
gladly teach you how to get yourself so worked up over your enemy that
you will forget about everything except smashing your enemies into a
bloody pulp.  This rage grants you an extra attack, and +2 to damage.
It also increases (makes worse) your armor class by 30 points.  You will
not be able to flee while berserking, and you cannot constantly beserk;
you must rest for a bit afterwards before attempting it again.
Berserking also tends to cause you to work up an appetite.  This is an
OGRE ONLY skill!
#
"NEWSTUFF"
6/3/1993

- Mobiles have randomly generated stats.

- Exp loss is changed.  If you are under 5th level, you lose only 1/5th
  when you die.  If you are under 10th level, you lose 1/4th.  Characters
  under 15th lose 1/3, and all higher level exp losses remain at 1/2.

- You can now lose a level if you die too much.  If you die after you already
  have less than 1/16 of the experience needed for your level(s), you will
  lose a level.  This amounts to dying 6 times in a row without getting ANY
  exp in between.  You will receive a warning message if you are getting
  close to this danger zone.

New changes that will be implemented by aug 31.

+10)  More exp required per level for the higher levels.  (To encourage
	high level players to go to tougher areas) (almost done)
18)  More monsters for monsum 5, 6 and 7 (done)
23)  Each character will have to go on a quest for some item for each
	level.  A successful completion of ALL quests will mean that
	(in theory) the player has gone to almost every area at least once.
35)  Tell may be disabled for mortal-mortal conversations.
36)  Player killing will be modified as follows:  Evil characters will 
	be able to kill other evil characters, and good characters.
	Good characters will be able to kill evil characters.  All other
	forms of player killing will be investigated, and justice will
	be swiftly enacted.

Other changes will be added here.  The changes listed are open for 
discussion, but it is very doubtful that discussion will change anything,
unless you can find an equally reasonable change with similar effects.

We recognize that these changes will make the game harder.  It will also
make it more balanced, and encourage more adventuring, and less repetition.
These mods will not all necessarily take effect at one time, so things
will be Very chaotic for a time, until they are all in.

Items marked with a (*) are not as high priority.
#
"ROOM TELEPORT"

some new things for teleport rooms:


edit tele <time> <room> <flags> [<countdown>]

flags = 
1     LOOK    (do a look when you get teleported
2     COUNT   (this is a countdown room)
4     RANDOM  (after the first teleport, this room will teleport in random
		time)
8     SPIN    (Not implemented yet)


Some things to note:

 if you are going to set the COUNT flag, then leave the <time> = 0

 COUNT, RANDOM and SPIN are more or less mutually exclusive.


examples

   edit tele 30 1000 1       ;  teleport fires every 30 ticks, goes to room
			        1000, does a look

   edit tele  0 1000 3 30    ; 30 ticks after a player enters this room,
				they will be teleported to room 1000, and
				they will do a look.

   edit tele  0 1000 2 30    ; 30 ticks after a player enters this room,
				they will be teleported to room 1000, and they
				will NOT do a look

Any questions, post them on the board

The random time will be between 10 and 100 ticks

(so roughly between 7.5 seconds and 75 seconds)

Note, this is a god command, mortals can't do it.

#
"INTRO INTRODUCTION"

   things you should know:

   hit points are ad&d like, not diku like
   there are 150+ spells, almost 30 skills, more on the way.
   many monsters have special routines.
   most monsters that might have poison do.
   poison is very dangerous.
   some poisonous monsters have instantly fatal poison.  take care!
   equipment can be damaged, by spells and combat.
   dragons breath, doing lots of damage to people and equipment.
   non pc followers only get 1/2 the exp they would get if they weren't
   charmed.  the other 1/2 is lost.
   Some monsters are too big to bash.. in general, dragons, most 'huge'
   things, purple worm, etc, are all non-bashable.
   sneak allows you to avoid aggressive monsters.
   monsters develop hatreds very quickly, and will try to hunt you down  
   and kill you for hurting them.
   kangaroos hate all kinds of enfan.
   most mobs that should see in the dark do.
   some monsters are immune to the things you would expect them to be
   immune to.   
   some monsters are also resistant to certain attacks and/or susceptible
   to others (resist = 1/2 damage, susc = 2* dam)
   monsters HELP each other out.  They don't sit by and watch.

   
   player characters are very powerful:  many many spells, attacks, etc.
   monsters are weaker individually, most of the time.  However, the   
   monsters here are not as stupid as they are on other muds, and they
   tend to be tougher, because of that, and because they help each
   other.

   rule of thumb:  Grouping is a good idea.  

   it is easier to play mages and thieves if you are patient.  You don't
   have to be as patient, if you are more willing to group.

   My goals for the classes:
     Fighters: powerful at lower levels, much less useful at higher levels.
     Clerics:  reasonably powerful and useful all along.
     Mages:    weak at lower levels, more powerful at higher levels.
     Thieves:  Good for scouting, very nice when grouped.
     Monks:    Weak at lower levels, more powerful at higher levels.
     Druids:   Medium at all levels, like clerics.

   spellcasting is harder to do in combat.  generally, the more powerful
   the spell, the harder to cast in combat.  magic missile, acid blast,
   shocking grasp, cause light, serious, critical, are all fairly easy
   to cast in combat.

   While your equipment can be damamged by spells and such, there are some
   things you can do do minimize the damage.  #1, if you are fighting something
   that does fire damage, being immune or resistant to fire yourself will
   help your equipment out as well.   Good saves will also in general reduce
   the amount of damage.

"AUTHORIZE AUTH"


  auth Newbie yes        (lets them into the game)

  auth Newbie anything else  (a message to the Newbie)
#
HOUSEAUCTION

   There are no houses currently on the market.


#
"HOUSES HOUSE"

   Houses allow the character who owns it to rent for free.  The character
enters the house, and types rent,and all the stuff is stored.  No one else can
rent in that room, just the owner.  Multi-room houses are legal.  Note:
  No 'gates' will be allowed, the house must be geographically correct.
(i.e. all entrances and exits must be close to each other).

  As a reward for godhood, Players who make godhood will be able to 
purchase houses at a fixed rate (if they so desire) instead of the auction 
price.

#
"MAYOR"

   A character who kills the mayor in single combat earns the right to 
   be the mayor for 1 realworld week.  (from the day of the fight)

   The fight has to be witnessed by a 54th level god (or higher).

   Player cannot flee from combat.  Flight indicates loss, and the player
   cannot try again for 1 real day.

   Mages and clerics can use NPC followers.  No PC assistance (or god)
   will be allowed.

   Once the mayor has been killed, no other fights will be honored for
   the period of one week.. ignorance of the fact that the mayor position
   is still taken is of no consequence.

   The mayor of the week will have her (or his) name placed on the 
   message of the day.  If that person reaches immortality during
   that week, they will be removed from the mayor list, and the position
   will once again be open.

   I am also considering allowing the mayor of the week to call for
   cityguards, but i have not decided.

#
"RESURRECTION"

 if the spell is cast on the corpse of a player:

	Resurrection requires a sacrifice of 150,000 coins, and the
  beneficiary loses 1 con point permanently.. after the con reaches
  3, no more ressurection can occur.

IMPORTANT:  The dead character has to stay OUT of the game until
	he/she is resurrected.  If he/she reenters the game, he/she
	cannot be resurrected.  All the way out. I.E. all the way out of
	telnet.  If you are at the choice menu, tough luck - you were
        warned!

  The caster is brought to 1 hit point, 1 mana and 1 movement point.

if the spell is cast on the corpse of a monster:

   That monster becomes a loyal follower of the caster, for 36 game hours.

 NOTE!!!!!!!!
     Those numbers are ROUGH!  And just because an area is advertised
for X level does not necessarily mean that X level can wipe out the area!!!
Use COMMON SENSE.  ASK people about the areas, find experienced people to
group with.  Don't get cocky, and you'll live longer.   Be social, and you
will live longer.  Ask questions, and you will live longer.

P.S. if anyone feels these numbers are not accurate, post a message.
 
#
"MONSUM"

   the various incarnations of this spell create monsters of the appropriate
   level to serve you as followers for a time.  The time is as long as the
   time that charm person would work on the same creature.

is that it is cast in the following manner:

Used for sneaking (moving in and out of rooms without anyone taking

three rounds of 'Violence' - so be sure that you do not need to flee!
This is one of the Monks most awesome weapons.  Use it wisely.

#
BASH

someone is to attempt to 'knock' that person over. If you succeed you

person being rescued. You can only 'turn' one monster for each
attempt. This is highly useful when playing in groups.
#
STEAL

Use steal to steal gold or items from people. The chance of not
getting caught depends on how well you have practiced steal, and if
the person is asleep.

Due to misuse of the steal command, it now requires at least 1,250 XP
points to steal from other players. You can still steal from monsters
at all levels.


Example:

> steal gold drunk

#
BACKSTAB

Thief only.

Is a way to sneak up on a person, and attempt to place you dagger in
his back, at exactly the point where it does most damage. A successful
backstab gives a damage multiplier, depending on level.

	Levels 1 - 7: x2		Levels 8 -15: x3
	Levels 16-24: x4		Levels 25-32: x5
	Levels 33-38: x6		Levels 39-43: x7
	Levels 44-48: x8		Level   49  : x9

			Level   50  : x10

Now for the nitty gritty stuff.  Sneaking does help you backstab.
You always have to be sneaking to backstab aggressive creature.
In order to backstab a huge creature you have to be flying and you will
not do as much damage.  Certain races like slimes, ghosts, undead, are
not very affected by backstabbing.  In order to backstab, you need to
make a successful skill check, and then a successful to-hit check.
Backstab damage is figured out my multiplying your weapon damage,
INCLUDING your plusses to damage by your multiplier.  Your multiplier
is modified depending on how well you know your victim's innards.
This knowledge is reflected in various lores taught to you by the
LoreMaster.  Your base multiplier is determined by your level and can
be determined on the above chart.  If you were attempting to backstab
a humanoid, a check is made with your "people lore" skill.  Numerically,
this ammounts to the following:  If I am not-learned (learned = 0) then
my multiplier is multiplied by .1 ( (how learned + 10) / 100). So, this
pretty much nukes my multiplier.  If I am learned at Superb (95) then
my multiplier is multiplied by 1.05 ( (95 + 10) / 100) and my multiplier
all hunky dory.  Your lore will improve via multiple uses of backstab,
of course which lore is improved depends on what you backstab.

#
CAST
For "magical" people. If you want to throw a spell at someone or something.
Example : cast 'burning hands' <player>
   Note that the name of the spell must be enclosed by "'"s.

See also : help on each individual spell, for example:

#
DROP
If you lose interest in a carried item, you can drop it on the ground.
Example : drop bottle
  If you feel like getting rid of all your earthly possessions, you

bottles, but leave the rest in your hands.

#
SHOPS
  Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his
quests, and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to
survive the perils with his life and sanity intact. Many shops trade
only in a specific type of merchandise. Thus, a baker may well refuse
to buy your armor, even if it is of high quality!
  To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a
shop by murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The
shopkeepers are rugged, capable men and women; roughened by years of
trading and, indeed, surviving in a world where the only safe prospect
is death in the end.  (They usually have a few thousand hitpoints and
can shoot through schools).

See also: SPELL COMMAND
#
WARRIOR FIGHTER
  Warriors are known to have more strength than the average player.
This makes them better at hand-to-hand-combat, as they possess skills
of violence and fighting unequaled by the members of any other class.
However, they lack the ability to use magic of any sort.
  You can improve your skills by using the practice command, in the
room in the swordspeople's guild with the guildmaster (usually the
last room)

See also: PRACTICE
#
THIEF
  Thieves are known to have very special qualities, that no other
class offers.  Many of these qualities can come in handy in many
situations, such as picking locks.  They are not very combat oriented,
however, so do not expect to be able to kill many things by yourself.
The useful aspect of thieves involves their ability to scout ahead,
avoiding monsters, detecting and removing traps and selling and buying
items at the black market.
   You can improve you skills by using the practice command.

See also: PRACTICE
#
CLERIC
  This class gives you the wisdom of peace, blessing and healing,
though it is possible to learn more violent spells.  You can improve
your spells by using the practice command.

See also: PRACTICE
#
"MAGIC USER" WIZARD MAGE
  This is the class of powerful and violent magic, but the magic user
does not control the nature, and can therefore not bless and such. You
can improve your spells by using the practice command.

See also: PRACTICE
#
PRACTICE PRACTISE
  Practice is the way you improve your spells and skills. You must go
to your guildmaster to let him/her help you improve (GAIN).  If you type
practice, you will see which skills you can improve upon, and how good
you already are at these.  You can then use practice <skill>, to
practice the appropriate skill.  You can only practise a certain
amount for each level you gain, and you do not have to use this, it
can be accumulated.

See also: GAIN
#
EXITS
  Gives you a list of the obvious exits from your location. Of course,
the less obvious ones will not show up here - you have to THINK in

#
LEAVE

nearest obvious exit to the outside.

ENTER
  If you type 'enter' while you are outdoors, you will enter any
nearby shelter.  You can also follow 'enter' with an argument; for
example, 'enter window'.

#
TIME
  Gives you the current 'gametime'. Your initial reaction to the
output of this command may be one of surprise, but you will get used
to it. you will have to, at any rate, since certain things in the game
depend on this particular notion of time; the opening hours of the
shops, for example.

#
BUG TYPO IDEA
For making useful suggestions to the maintainers of the game. Examples:

bug the entire game crashes when I type 'put bag in bag'
idea make a restaurant in Midgaard
typo 'sence' should be spelled 'sense'
#
QUIT
  When you get tired of playing, you can leave the game by typing
'quit'. Note that whatever stuff you might be carrying with you is
simply left on the ground. If you wish to have your equipment put away
until you are able to come back, you will have to find an inn.

See also: INN
#
INN INNS
  Inns are places where the weary traveler may rest while the
innkeeper looks after his equipment and treasure. Specifically, you
may use inns to store your gathered equipment while you are not
playing the game (we all have to sleep sometimes, there is no shame in
that).

See also: OFFER, RENT
#
OFFER RENT
  For use in the receptions of inns. The command 'offer' will make the
innkeeper tell you the cost of storing your carried items for one day.
'rent' will store the items and make you leave the game. The next time
you enter, you will start out in the reception where you left. The inn
will store your items as long as you have the gold to pay the rent.

See also: INN
#
GET TAKE
  If you find something interesting on the ground, you may use 'get'
to pick it up. Example: "get greatsword". If you are in a hurry, or if
you just feel very greedy, you may type "get all". You can also use
'get' to extract objects from containers. Example: "get dagger from
bag".  Other examples:
  get all.bread from bag
  get 9*bread from bag
  get all from corpse

Fixed! There is no longer any ambiguity between containers in your
inventory and on the ground.  The ones in your inventory are 1..n and
the ones on the ground are (n+1)..(n+m).

in your note at the keyboard.

#
NEWS
  This command will show you the current edition of "the DikuMUD
Herald", a publication dedicated to news and useful information about
this world. It is a VERY good idea to check it out once in a while.

idea to sit and rest for awhile; or maybe even take a nap.

#
POUR
If you want to pour some liquid from one container to another.
#
GRAB
For getting a good grip on something; a torch, for example.

See also: WEAR, WIELD, REMOVE
#
FOLLOW
  If you happen to be going in the same direction as someone else, why
not simply follow that person? For example: "Follow joe". If you are
following someone and you wish to stop doing that, then all you have
to do is follow yourself: "follow <your name>".

#
FLEE
  If you are in a fight and things are beginning to get a little
uncomfortable (maybe you are about to die), just type 'flee', and
presto! you are out of harm's way - that is, IF you are still standing
and, IF there is a suitable exit nearby, and IF that exit does not
simply take you out of the frying pan and into the fire... but then,
who wants to live forever?

*** NEW ADDITION TO FLEE ***
Usage: FLEE <number>     (ie, if you use flee with an argument)

#
GUILD
  The Guildhouse is the place where mortals may go to escape the
troubles and perils of a cruel world. Each guild is heavily guarded
(HA!), so that only members may enter the building. Guilds are also
the places where people come to learn and practice the skills of their
trade.

The Clerics guild is located west of the temple square.  
The Mages guild is located just east of the west gate, south of the wizards
shop.
The Thieves guild is located in a dark alley
The Warriors guild is located just west of the east gate, south from the
weaponsmith's shop
The Monk's guild is farther away, west and north from took hill in the shire
The Druids guild is in the forest of Haon-daor, near a small cabin
in the woods. (levels 9 and under).. The 10th+ level druid guild is
inside the colossal tree.  You MUST have the spell 'tree travelling' to get
inside your guild, so be warned.  You almost definitely need the spell
'Flame Blade' to win the competition required for each level.

Note.. these are multi-room complexes..  once you enter the entrance, type
exits, to see where the bar is, and you can get from the bar to the 
practice/guildmaster area.

Once at the guildmaster, you can practice spells and skills.

command. Frequently, you will find small, but vital hints in the

mean the difference between life and death!

into account.

"PLAYER KILLING"

   Killing of newbies (characters up to 5th level, and the first belonging to 
that character) is ABSOLUTELY forbidden.  

   Killing of experienced players, while not specifically forbidden, is 
frowned upon, and if a player becomes a problem, he or she can be penalized, 
barred from the game, or deleted.  Also, since the decisions of 59rd levellers
is final, the actions taken by gods after a player killing can be somewhat 
unpredictable.

advance him one level. A level 0 player (Man/Woman) is always only
advanced by one level.

#
LINK

A lot of players have problems with their links to the game. This
could be very dangerous to your health in the middle of a combat. But
we have worked out a solution. There are two cases:

  I.If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee
    each time someone attempts to hit you. If you manage to flee, then
    you will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until
    you reconnect to the game.

 II.If your link jams (freezes) you got a problem. The only solution
    we can give, is that you break your link as quickly as possible. By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

#
COMPACT
  If you have a small display you might want to use this command. It
turns off (or on) the extra newline after output to your screen.

Usage: WIMP <number>    (or just WIMP to keep the current percent)

   If you are in wimp mode, you will flee when you are down to X%

in WIMP mode, this percentage is when you will start seeing those BLEEDING 
messages.  Valid percents are 1 to 50.  Type WIMP again to toggle ON and OFF.

INFRA INFRAVISION
   Infravision is a spell that allows you to see heat sources in
otherwise dark conditions.  It does not allow you to read scrolls, or

of heat may cause temporary blindness in Infravision-affected players
and monsters.

#
EDIT
   Edit allows you to edit rooms.  The room you are currently in is
the one that is edited.  You can edit any room, but the changes will
not be permanent.  However, using the rsave, and rload commands, you
can save your changes into a file, and reload them later into the
game, (if it crashes, for example).

NOTE: If you are confused by this, and try it anyway, you may crash
    the game.  Please be very sure that you know what you are doing.
    Also, try to avoid making too many changes to the existent areas
    for the moment.

Also note: You need to have an area, before you start editing it. this
does not create rooms, only edits them.  Contact Loki if you want an
area.  Also ask him any questions that you have about room editing.

BREATH
  The breath command allows you to use a breath weapon on another
monster.  The only way to get a breath weapon is to either be a
monster with such an ability (dragons usually have one) or quaff a
potion of fire/ice/acid/gas/lightning breath.

  If you are already fighting, breath without any arguments will
breath on the monster you are fighting.  If you are NOT fighting you
must supply the name of a target to breath on.

  Breath weapons are terrifying and most opponents will flee before
you get a chance to breath on them.  However, you may blast bystanders
with the same breath.

  This means breath weapons are not terribly accurate.  You will
always hit the monster you target and will usually hit his group,
followers and his leader.  You will also probably blast anyone
currently hitting on you.  You also have a small chance (less than
half) of hitting each bystander (someone not covered above).  They
will not appreciate this and will probably decide to beat the snot out
of you.

  When quaffed breath potions modify you so that you can breath ONE
time.  If you do not breath in 2-3 rounds the potion will explode
inside you causing half of its normal damage.  These potions also
reduce your CON for the duration of the spell.  You therefore cannot
quaff more breath weapon levels than you have constitution.  You also
cannot quaff more breath weapon levels than you have levels.

  The damage of a breath weapon is a function of its level, your
level, and your hitpoints.  If your level is equal to the breath
weapon's level it will do your hitpoints worth of damage to the
target.  If your level is double the level of the breath weapon it
will only do half your hitpoints of damage.  Monsters natural breath
weapons exceed the CON restriction and even a 50th level monster can
do full damage.  Since most huge monsters have huge hitpoints, this can
be a LOT of damage.  do not ever fight a titanium dragon.

#
ASSIST

  If you type "assist <player>" you will begin fighting the same
person the <player> is.

  ASSIST is similar to RESCUE except the <player> continues fighting.
It is better than KILL in many cases because you do not have to choose
between 1.golem and 2.golem (or 1.lamia that just entered the room).
Even though monsters of the same type assist each other in combat,
ASSIST is better because you will eliminate one aggressor much faster.

not gain any more experience points than those needed to place you one away
from the next highest level.
