DISPLAY
Usage : DISPLAY [0..1]

Display allows you to change your term setup on the mud, allowing you to
have an info-bar on the bottom of your screen.  The info-bar contains
your hit points, your mana, your movement points, your gold, and your
experience points.

   Currently, display uses VT100 term setups.  To turn display onto
VT100, use the "1" option.  To turn off the VT100 display, use the "0"
option.

RESIZE
Usage : RESIZE [size]

Resize allows you to change your screen size.  The default is a 25 line
screen, but not everyone uses 25 lines.  Resize allows you to change
your setup to your own screen size (allow for a total line count).
RESIZE 25 would reset you to a normal display size.

DISGUISE

Disguise is a skill that allows thieves to disguise themselves.  What
does this mean, I hear you cry.  WEll.  This won't do squat against pcs.
BUT, those pesky mobs that hate you and fear you will forget who you are
if you disguise yourself well.   This is a learnable skill.
#
"GROUP GROUPING"
Usage : GROUP [player]

Some new changes to encourage grouping.   
1) leader of a group gets 5% exp bonus per kill per pc in group
2) followers get 3% bonus (per pc)
3) all damage has been reduced by 25%.  Both you and mobs will do less

If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for
killing monsters equally among the group. Experience points will only
be shared among group members that are in the same location, at the
time of the killing blow. Sharing is regardless of whether the group
members have been participating in the fight.

Group with no argument show a list of people with whom you are grouped.

To make a group, a "leader" must be selected. All members of the group
must then "follow" the leader using the follow command. The leader
should NOT follow anyone at all! The leader can now toggle group
membership for each player in the group, by using "group
<player_name>". The leader should remember to include himself in the
group.

Example:

Quifael and Redferne wishes to group with Dragon.

Quifael : "follow dragon"
Redferne: "follow dragon"
(Dragon should be following no one but himself)
Dragon  : "group dragon"
Dragon  : "group redferne"
Dragon  : "group quifael"

Later when Dragon get upset at Quifael (because he is sleeping all the
time) he types : "Group Quifael" to kick Quifael out of the group.

"UNHOLY WORD"

#
"NEWBIE"
These are a few things that should help you get past your first few levels.

Most important:
 -People of the same race will assist each other in battles.
  This means that attacking a creature when others of it's kind
  are around is not very wise unless you can take them all on.
 -Be PATIENT, levels do not necessarily come overnight.  Fast gains
  are usually risky and lead to death too often.
 -If in doubt about something, ask someone.

Others:
  -Cityguards and Royal Guards do jump into battles.  They will jump
   in on the side of the person with the higher alignment.  All
   newbies have an alignment of zero.
  -There are rules concerning Player Killing.  Read them, they are
   located above the Temple Altar.
  -Some skills you only need to invest one practice into, and then you can
   improve them with use.  This especially applies to Monks and Thieves.

Mages:
  -Learn Magic Missile, it helps.

Clerics:
  -Avoid getting lower level version of spells if you think that you can
   get to a high enough level to use a more powerful version. For example
   practice cure serious instead of cure light if you can get by without
   cure light.

Druids:
  -Learn Tree Travel at 10th, or else you won't be able to advance past
   that.
  -Learn Flame Blade, or else getting past 10th will be a real pain.

Areas that you can go to at low levels:

Chessboard   (pawns are easy, rest are easier at a bit higher levels)
	 from the western gate, go south a couple of times, and west
Midgaard     (Vampire bats are good exp, may need to be 2nd, though)
	unless you are a halfling, this is the city you start in.
Zoo          (Nursery has monsters in them.)
	straight south from the city dump
White Plume  (At least a 5th level group.)
             White Plume Mountain is westwards down the river from the Levee.
Hallways     (Varying levels)
	located inside the temple of midgaard
Moria        (North From Crossroads, at least 5th level group, hostile area.)
Deadhame     (In Graveyard, ask someone where that is :)
Shire        (Youths are good for 2-3+ levels, it is northwest from Midgaard)
Beneath the
 Monks Guild (There is an area here, has useful potions, good for groups
              of 2-3+)
	the monks guild is east and north from the shire.

If you have any comments about things you think you should see here, post
them on the board, and we will see what we can do about adding them.

"MONK DAMAGE"
This is a list of the bare hand damage a monk does at various levels.  A monk
must not be wielding a weapon.

Level  Damage     Level  Damage     Level  Damage     Level  Damage
 1- 3   1d3       15-19   2d4       30-34   4d4       42-44   6d4

#
"ARMOR CLASS"
Armor Class is based on the AD&D idea that the lower ones AC is, the
less often they get hit.  Armor classes range from "barely armored"
to "armored like a tank".  In numeric terms, this is a rnage from 100
to -100.  If you are acquainted with AD&D, a 100 corresponds to a 10 AC,
and a -100 corresponds to a -10 AC.  Dexterity also affects how often
you get hit, the higher your dexterity (up to 18) the lower your natural
AC (your AC without any armor or spells on).  For every point of
dexterity above 15 (16+) your natural (100) AC is reduced by 10.  This
does not apply to monks.
#
"IDENTIFY"
Purchasing a scroll of identify from Zifnab, or finding a scroll
similarly empowered will enable you to see some of the more important
statistics of an item.  The scrolls may also be used on a monster or
player (sometimes there is little difference) with much less of an
effect. 
#
"MONK ATTACKS"
The formula used for the number of attacks that an unarmed monk will get per
round will be: (level-1)/16 +1   --The fractional portion will provide the
probability of getting an extra attack each round. (ie. if you were VERY
lucky, a 2nd level monk could get 2 attacks every round, but probably won't)

[a few samples: Level--#Att]
 1--1.00    5--1.25    9--1.50   13--1.75   17--2.00   21--2.25   25--2.50
29--2.75   33--3.00   37--3.25   41--3.50   45--3.75   49--4.00

  Spying helps a thief character gain information about the world around 
him/her.  After one has typed 'spy', one can look in various directions,
and given that there is an exit in that direction, and nothing blocking
the way (like a closed door), then the contents of the other room will
be displayed.

person.  Usually, it will tell that person that you are looking at a particular
item.. however, if you successfully spy, they won't notice.
#
"DOORBASH"

  Doorbashing is a skill that allows one to open locked doors.  One must
refer to the door by name, not the direction of travel.  For example
doorbash gate
doorbash door north
etc.

  Success means that the door is unlocked and opened and the attempter is placed
in the room on the other side of the door, while failure causes the attempter 
to be stunned for a short time, and take a fair amount of damage in the process.
#

If one types "disarm trapname", if the player has the disarm traps skill,
one can attempt to disable the trap.. failure indicates a high probability
that the trap will be sprung on the player attempting the disarm.

#
"SIGN"
   You can learn to use sign language now.  Useful when underwater,
or in a silenced room, (or silenced yourself).  whatever the user types
is broadcast, possibly somewhat garbled depending on his/her skill with
signing, and all those in the room who understand sign language will 
receive the possibly garbled message.

#
"MOUNT RIDE RIDING"

  it is now possible to mount horses and dragons.. Certain aspects are
not finalized, so it is not advisable to mount aggressive dragons.  Currently
there are no horses of the correct race to be ridden, so, for the moment, it
is only possible to ride dragons.  However, dragons are not docile creatures,
and it will take a large amount of riding skill, and a high level character
to do it with any amount of ability.  You can order your mount to do things,
as if he/she was a follower, but he/she isn't, so you can't group with the
mount.  Each time you attack something, or your mount attacks something, or
each time you take damage or your mount takes damage, you have a chance of
being thrown from the back of your mount.  

it is easier for evil chars to ride evil dragons, and good chars to ride
good dragons.  

  To get an idea of how powerful one has to be to ride dragons, 
a 60th level character can typically only successfully ride on
Yevaud if said character has a -1000 alignment, or is affected
by the dragon-riding spell.  Or if yevaud is heavily damaged.

   > alias 1 kill

   You hit the lamia.

   Get the idea?   Only one cmmand per alias, I have been having nightmares
	trying to figure out all the ways one could crash the game with
        multi-command aliases

#
"DODGE"

	dodge allows fighters and monks to avoid damage in combat.  not 
	a lot -- 1-3 points, but every little bit helps.  Each time you
	are hit, the game checks your dodge skill, which does not improve
	with use, only with practice.  if you make it, the damage is 
	reduced by 1-3 points.. note- this applies to physical attacks
	only.

#
"RETREAT"
	allows a fighter, thief or monk to get out of combat without 
	having to panic and flee. if you make the roll, you WILL leave
	the room, and you lose no exp for doing it.  

	this skill gets better through use.

	this skill does not have a name of its own, but is built in
	to the 'flee' command.

#
"FEIGN DEATH"
	allows a monk to pretend that they are dead.  The people/things
	that are attacking you will stop fighting you, and may leave you
	alone completely, although it is best to leave the room as soon
	as possible.
#
"NEWSTUFF"

New changes that will be implemented by aug 31.

+10)  More exp required per level for the higher levels.  (To encourage
	high level players to go to tougher areas) (almost done)
18)  More monsters for monsum 5, 6 and 7 (done)
23)  Each character will have to go on a quest for some item for each
	level.  A successful completion of ALL quests will mean that
	(in theory) the player has gone to almost every area at least once.
35)  Tell may be disabled for mortal-mortal conversations.
36)  Player killing will be modified as follows:  Evil characters will 
	be able to kill other evil characters, and good characters.
	Good characters will be able to kill evil characters.  All other
	forms of player killing will be investigated, and justice will
	be swiftly enacted.

Other changes will be added here.  The changes listed are open for 
discussion, but it is very doubtful that discussion will change anything,
unless you can find an equally reasonable change with similar effects.

We recognize that these changes will make the game harder.  It will also
make it more balanced, and encourage more adventuring, and less repetition.
These mods will not all necessarily take effect at one time, so things
will be Very chaotic for a time, until they are all in.

Items marked with a (*) are not as high priority.
#
"ROOM TELEPORT"

some new things for teleport rooms:


edit tele <time> <room> <flags> [<countdown>]

flags = 
1     LOOK    (do a look when you get teleported
2     COUNT   (this is a countdown room)
4     RANDOM  (after the first teleport, this room will teleport in random
		time)
8     SPIN    (Not implemented yet)


Some things to note:

 if you are going to set the COUNT flag, then leave the <time> = 0

 COUNT, RANDOM and SPIN are more or less mutually exclusive.


examples

   edit tele 30 1000 1       ;  teleport fires every 30 ticks, goes to room
			        1000, does a look

   edit tele  0 1000 3 30    ; 30 ticks after a player enters this room,
				they will be teleported to room 1000, and
				they will do a look.

   edit tele  0 1000 2 30    ; 30 ticks after a player enters this room,
				they will be teleported to room 1000, and they
				will NOT do a look

Any questions, post them on the board

The random time will be between 10 and 100 ticks

(so roughly between 7.5 seconds and 75 seconds)

Note, this is a god command, mortals can't do it.

#
"INTRO INTRODUCTION"

   things you should know:

   hit points are ad&d like, not diku like
   there are 150+ spells, almost 30 skills, more on the way.
   many monsters have special routines.
   most monsters that might have poison do.
   poison is very dangerous.
   some poisonous monsters have instantly fatal poison.  take care!
   equipment can be damaged, by spells and combat.
   dragons breath, doing lots of damage to people and equipment.
   non pc followers only get 1/2 the exp they would get if they weren't
   charmed.  the other 1/2 is lost.
   Some monsters are too big to bash.. in general, dragons, most 'huge'
   things, purple worm, etc, are all non-bashable.
   sneak allows you to avoid aggressive monsters.
   monsters develop hatreds very quickly, and will try to hunt you down  
   and kill you for hurting them.
   kangaroos hate all kinds of enfan.
   most mobs that should see in the dark do.
   some monsters are immune to the things you would expect them to be
   immune to.   
   some monsters are also resistant to certain attacks and/or susceptible
   to others (resist = 1/2 damage, susc = 2* dam)
   monsters HELP each other out.  They don't sit by and watch.

   
   player characters are very powerful:  many many spells, attacks, etc.
   monsters are weaker individually, most of the time.  However, the   
   monsters here are not as stupid as they are on other muds, and they
   tend to be tougher, because of that, and because they help each
   other.

   rule of thumb:  Grouping is a good idea.  

   it is easier to play mages and thieves if you are patient.  You don't
   have to be as patient, if you are more willing to group.

   My goals for the classes:
     Fighters: powerful at lower levels, much less useful at higher levels.
     Clerics:  reasonably powerful and useful all along.
     Mages:    weak at lower levels, more powerful at higher levels.
     Thieves:  Good for scouting, very nice when grouped.
     Monks:    Weak at lower levels, more powerful at higher levels.
     Druids:   Medium at all levels, like clerics.

   spellcasting is harder to do in combat.  generally, the more powerful
   the spell, the harder to cast in combat.  magic missile, acid blast,
   shocking grasp, cause light, serious, critical, are all fairly easy
   to cast in combat.

   While your equipment can be damamged by spells and such, there are some
   things you can do do minimize the damage.  #1, if you are fighting something
   that does fire damage, being immune or resistant to fire yourself will
   help your equipment out as well.   Good saves will also in general reduce
   the amount of damage.

"AUTHORIZE AUTH"

#
HOUSEAUCTION

   There are no houses currently on the market.


#
"HOUSES HOUSE"

   Houses allow the character who owns it to rent for free.  The character
enters the house, and types rent,and all the stuff is stored.  No one else can
rent in that room, just the owner.  Multi-room houses are legal.  Note:
  No 'gates' will be allowed, the house must be geographically correct.
(i.e. all entrances and exits must be close to each other).

  As a reward for godhood, Players who make godhood will be able to 
purchase houses at a fixed rate (if they so desire) instead of the auction 
price.

#
"MAYOR"

   A character who kills the mayor in single combat earns the right to 
   be the mayor for 1 realworld week.  (from the day of the fight)

   The fight has to be witnessed by a 54th level god (or higher).

   Player cannot flee from combat.  Flight indicates loss, and the player
   cannot try again for 1 real day.

   Mages and clerics can use NPC followers.  No PC assistance (or god)
   will be allowed.

   Once the mayor has been killed, no other fights will be honored for
   the period of one week.. ignorance of the fact that the mayor position
   is still taken is of no consequence.

   The mayor of the week will have her (or his) name placed on the 
   message of the day.  If that person reaches immortality during
   that week, they will be removed from the mayor list, and the position
   will once again be open.

   I am also considering allowing the mayor of the week to call for
   cityguards, but i have not decided.

#
"RESURRECTION"

 if the spell is cast on the corpse of a player:

	Resurrection requires a sacrifice of 150,000 coins, and the
  beneficiary loses 1 con point permanently.. after the con reaches
  3, no more ressurection can occur.

IMPORTANT:  The dead character has to stay OUT of the game until
	he/she is resurrected.  If he/she reenters the game, he/she
	cannot be resurrected.  All the way out. I.E. all the way out of
	telnet.

  The caster is brought to 1 hit point, 1 mana and 1 movement point.

if the spell is cast on the corpse of a monster:

   That monster becomes a loyal follower of the caster, for 36 game hours.

 NOTE!!!!!!!!
     Those numbers are ROUGH!  And just because an area is advertised
for X level does not necessarily mean that X level can wipe out the area!!!
Use COMMON SENSE.  ASK people about the areas, find experienced people to
group with.  Don't get cocky, and you'll live longer.   Be social, and you
will live longer.  Ask questions, and you will live longer.

P.S. if anyone feels these numbers are not accurate, post a message.

where you replace <creatue_type> with one of the creatures listed below.

SHOPS
  Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his
quests, and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to
survive the perils with his life and sanity intact. Many shops trade
only in a specific type of merchandise. Thus, a baker may well refuse
to buy your armor, even if it is of high quality!
  To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a
shop by murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The
shopkeepers are rugged, capable men and women; roughened by years of
trading and, indeed, surviving in a world where the only safe prospect
is death in the end.  (They usually have a few thousand hitpoints and
can shoot through schools).

#
COMMANDS
A mechanical listing (the code already exists) of the known verbs.
#
WARRIOR FIGHTER
  Warriors are known to have more strength than the average player.
This makes them better at hand-to-hand-combat, as they possess skills
of violence and fighting unequaled by the members of any other class.
However, they lack the ability to use magic of any sort.
  You can improve your skills by using the practice command, in the
room in the swordspeople's guild with the guildmaster (usually the
last room)

See also: PRACTICE
#
THIEF
  Thieves are known to have very special qualities, that no other
class offers.  Many of these qualities can come in handy in many
situations, such as picking locks.  They are not very combat oriented,
however, so do not expect to be able to kill many things by yourself.
The useful aspect of thieves involves their ability to scout ahead,
avoiding monsters, detecting and removing traps and selling and buying
items at the black market.
   You can improve you skills by using the practice command.

See also: PRACTICE
#
CLERIC
  This class gives you the wisdom of peace, blessing and healing,
though it is possible to learn more violent spells.  You can improve
your spells by using the practice command.

See also: PRACTICE
#
"MAGIC USER" WIZARD MAGE
  This is the class of powerful and violent magic, but the magic user
does not control the nature, and can therefore not bless and such. You
can improve your spells by using the practice command.

See also: PRACTICE
#
PRACTICE PRACTISE
  Practice is the way you improve your spells and skills. You must go
to your guildmaster to let him/her help you improve (GAIN).  If you type
practice, you will see which skills you can improve upon, and how good
you already are at these.  You can then use practice <skill>, to
practice the appropriate skill.  You can only practise a certain
amount for each level you gain, and you do not have to use this, it
can be accumulated.

See also: GAIN
#
EXITS
  Gives you a list of the obvious exits from your location. Of course,
the less obvious ones will not show up here - you have to THINK in
order to locate those.

#
LEAVE
  If you feel claustrophobic, typing 'leave' will make you use the
nearest obvious exit to the outside.

#
ENTER
  If you type 'enter' while you are outdoors, you will enter any
nearby shelter.  You can also follow 'enter' with an argument; for
example, 'enter window'.

#
TIME
  Gives you the current 'gametime'. Your initial reaction to the
output of this command may be one of surprise, but you will get used
to it. you will have to, at any rate, since certain things in the game
depend on this particular notion of time; the opening hours of the
shops, for example.

#
BUG TYPO IDEA
For making useful suggestions to the maintainers of the game. Examples:

bug the entire game crashes when I type 'put bag in bag'
idea make a restaurant in Midgaard
typo 'sence' should be spelled 'sense'
#
QUIT
  When you get tired of playing, you can leave the game by typing
'quit'. Note that whatever stuff you might be carrying with you is
simply left on the ground. If you wish to have your equipment put away
until you are able to come back, you will have to find an inn.

See also: INN
#
INN INNS
  Inns are places where the weary traveler may rest while the
innkeeper looks after his equipment and treasure. Specifically, you
may use inns to store your gathered equipment while you are not
playing the game (we all have to sleep sometimes, there is no shame in
that).

See also: OFFER, RENT
#
OFFER RENT
  For use in the receptions of inns. The command 'offer' will make the
innkeeper tell you the cost of storing your carried items for one day.
'rent' will store the items and make you leave the game. The next time
you enter, you will start out in the reception where you left. The inn
will store your items as long as you have the gold to pay the rent.

See also: INN
#
GET TAKE
  If you find something interesting on the ground, you may use 'get'
to pick it up. Example: "get greatsword". If you are in a hurry, or if
you just feel very greedy, you may type "get all". You can also use
'get' to extract objects from containers. Example: "get dagger from
bag".  Other examples:
  get all.bread from bag
  get 9*bread from bag
  get all from corpse

Fixed! There is no longer any ambiguity between containers in your
inventory and on the ground.  The ones in your inventory are 1..n and
the ones on the ground are (n+1)..(n+m).

See also: DROP PUT
#
PUT
For putting stuff in containers. Example: "Put the dagger in the bag".

similar), and a pen of some sort. You can then type something like
"write on the paper with the pen", whereupon you will be asked to type
in your note at the keyboard.

#
NEWS
  This command will show you the current edition of "the DikuMUD
Herald", a publication dedicated to news and useful information about
this world. It is a VERY good idea to check it out once in a while.
NOT checking it out will probably get you dead.

#
SLEEPING WAKE REST SIT STAND
  For changing your position. If you feel weary, It is probably a good
idea to sit and rest for awhile; or maybe even take a nap.

#
POUR
If you want to pour some liquid from one container to another.
#
GRAB
For getting a good grip on something; a torch, for example.

See also: WEAR, WIELD, REMOVE
#
FOLLOW
  If you happen to be going in the same direction as someone else, why
not simply follow that person? For example: "Follow joe". If you are
following someone and you wish to stop doing that, then all you have
to do is follow yourself: "follow <your name>".

#
FLEE
  If you are in a fight and things are beginning to get a little
uncomfortable (maybe you are about to die), just type 'flee', and
presto! you are out of harm's way - that is, IF you are still standing
and, IF there is a suitable exit nearby, and IF that exit does not
simply take you out of the frying pan and into the fire... but then,
who wants to live forever?

#
IMPLEMENTOR
  The most powerful beings in existence.  Their function is mostly
administrative.  Don't whine too much in their presence.
  Also, Hammor doesn't have the responsibilities of an implementor,
just the priveleges.  He only hacks code.

#
GUILD
  The Guildhouse is the place where mortals may go to escape the
troubles and perils of a cruel world. Each guild is heavily guarded
(HA!), so that only members may enter the building. Guilds are also
the places where people come to learn and practice the skills of their
trade.

The Clerics guild is located west of the temple square.  
The Mages guild is located just east of the west gate, south of the wizards
shop.
The Thieves guild is located in a dark alley
The Warriors guild is located just west of the east gate, south from the
weaponsmith's shop
The Monk's guild is farther away, west and north from took hill in the shire
The Druids guild is in the forest of Haon-daor, near a small cabin
in the woods. (levels 9 and under).. The 10th+ level druid guild is
inside the colossal tree.  You MUST have the spell 'tree travelling' to get
inside your guild, so be warned.  You almost definitely need the spell
'Flame Blade' to win the competition required for each level.

Note.. these are multi-room complexes..  once you enter the entrance, type
exits, to see where the bar is, and you can get from the bar to the 
practice/guildmaster area.

Once at the guildmaster, you can practice spells and skills.

command. Frequently, you will find small, but vital hints in the
descriptions of the rooms: An extra peek at your surroundings could
mean the difference between life and death!

See also: COMPACT
#

Repeat the last command typed at the keyboard.
#
CONSIDER
Usage : consider <monster>
  This command will compare your Level with the <monsters> level. You
will then receive a rough estimate, which is by no means exact.

bug reports :) Consider does not take hitpoints/special attacks/damage
into account.

Example:
  > consider fido

"PLAYER KILLING"

   Killing of newbies (characters up to 5th level, and the first belonging to 
that character) is ABSOLUTELY forbidden.  

   Killing of experienced players, while not specifically forbidden, is 
frowned upon, and if a player becomes a problem, he or she can be penalized, 
barred from the game, or deleted.  Also, since the decisions of 59rd levellers
is final, the actions taken by gods after a player killing can be somewhat 
unpredictable.

advance him one level. A level 0 player (Man/Woman) is always only

LINK

A lot of players have problems with their links to the game. This
could be very dangerous to your health in the middle of a combat. But
we have worked out a solution. There are two cases:

  I.If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee
    each time someone attempts to hit you. If you manage to flee, then
    you will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until
    you reconnect to the game.

 II.If your link jams (freezes) you got a problem. The only solution
    we can give, is that you break your link as quickly as possible. By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

#
COMPACT
  If you have a small display you might want to use this command. It
turns off (or on) the extra newline after output to your screen.

INFRA INFRAVISION
   Infravision is a spell that allows you to see heat sources in
otherwise dark conditions.  It does not allow you to read scrolls, or
find items.  In addition, usage of spells which create large amounts
of heat may cause temporary blindness in Infravision-affected players
and monsters.

#
EDIT
   Edit allows you to edit rooms.  The room you are currently in is
the one that is edited.  You can edit any room, but the changes will
not be permanent.  However, using the rsave, and rload commands, you
can save your changes into a file, and reload them later into the
game, (if it crashes, for example).

NOTE: If you are confused by this, and try it anyway, you may crash
    the game.  Please be very sure that you know what you are doing.
    Also, try to avoid making too many changes to the existent areas
    for the moment.

Also note: You need to have an area, before you start editing it. this
does not create rooms, only edits them.  Contact Loki if you want an
area.  Also ask him any questions that you have about room editing.

BREATH
  The breath command allows you to use a breath weapon on another
monster.  The only way to get a breath weapon is to either be a
monster with such an ability (dragons usually have one) or quaff a
potion of fire/ice/acid/gas/lightning breath.

  If you are already fighting, breath without any arguments will
breath on the monster you are fighting.  If you are NOT fighting you
must supply the name of a target to breath on.

  Breath weapons are terrifying and most opponents will flee before
you get a chance to breath on them.  However, you may blast bystanders
with the same breath.

  This means breath weapons are not terribly accurate.  You will
always hit the monster you target and will usually hit his group,
followers and his leader.  You will also probably blast anyone
currently hitting on you.  You also have a small chance (less than
half) of hitting each bystander (someone not covered above).  They
will not appreciate this and will probably decide to beat the snot out
of you.

  When quaffed breath potions modify you so that you can breath ONE
time.  If you do not breath in 2-3 rounds the potion will explode
inside you causing half of its normal damage.  These potions also
reduce your CON for the duration of the spell.  You therefore cannot
quaff more breath weapon levels than you have constitution.  You also
cannot quaff more breath weapon levels than you have levels.

  The damage of a breath weapon is a function of its level, your
level, and your hitpoints.  If your level is equal to the breath
weapon's level it will do your hitpoints worth of damage to the
target.  If your level is double the level of the breath weapon it
will only do half your hitpoints of damage.  Monsters natural breath
weapons exceed the CON restriction and even a 50th level monster can
do full damage.  Since most huge monsters have huge hitpoints, this can
be a LOT of damage.  do not ever fight a titanium dragon.

#
ASSIST

  If you type "assist <player>" you will begin fighting the same
person the <player> is.

  ASSIST is similar to RESCUE except the <player> continues fighting.
It is better than KILL in many cases because you do not have to choose
between 1.golem and 2.golem (or 1.lamia that just entered the room).
Even though monsters of the same type assist each other in combat,
ASSIST is better because you will eliminate one aggressor much faster.

not gain any more experience points than those needed to place you one away
from the next highest level.
