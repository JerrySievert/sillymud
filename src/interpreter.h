#define STATHELP \
"Your strength defines how hard you hit, how heavy a weapon you can wield,\n\r\
and how much you can carry.  Intelligence is a measure of how fast you\n\r\
learn, while wisdom dictates your ability to learn many different skills.\n\r\
Dexterity is a measure of quickness, and constitution represents physical\n\r\
hardiness.  Charisma modifies the number of monster followers you can \n\r\
have, and how much shopkeepers will charge for their wares.\n\r"

#define STORY     \
" Silly was started in august of 1991, by Loki.  It was based off of the \n\r\
original Diku source code.  It has gone through many major revisions, and\n\r\
has spawned several other muds.  Loki has had industrious help from \n\r\
many others, including DM, Ripper and Hammor, to name the 3 most \n\r\
helpful.  \n\r\
  Silly is currently being run on an Ardent Titan, a horrible machine \n\r\
that is unreliable, runs sys V unix, and cost $70,000.   Currently, \n\r\
the machine is used for nothing but running the game.  Recently, the \n\r\
administration staff at the University of Florida made an alaias \n\r\
for doldrums to silly, so it is now possible to telnet to \n\r\
silly.cis.ufl.edu .  \n\r\
   and that, more or less, is the story of Silly Mud.\n\r"
